                <h1>Case Study: Workday App</h1>
                <p>Making the app more user friendly.</p>
                <img src="images/workday.jpg" />
                <p>
                    For this project, we were to research an existing app or website that
                    needed work/to be redesigned. For this project, I chose Workday. After
                    conversing with friends who work with Workday for their employment.
                    They showed me the problems that they encountered and I redesigned
                    these and their feedback throughout this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this process, I discussed the app with people who use it
                    reguarly to understand the issues that it had and the areas that could
                    be improved. As I began to redesign each section, I would do a small
                    user test to make sure the design was userfriendly and appealing.
                </p>
                <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
                <p>School: Brigham Young University - Idaho</p>
                <p>Date Completed: March 2021</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>
                    "The Workday app provides secure, mobile access to your Workday
                    applications on-the-go." -App Store Desciption
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Workday app is an app designed to help workers and employers
                    manage their time, clock in and out, see announcements from their
                    place of work, request time off, and much more. My goal is to fix
                    several UX design problems to make the user experience stressfree and
                    simple.
                </p>
                <h3>Areas to Work on:</h3>
                <img src="images/wd/Workday3.jpg" />
                <p>
                    My goal is to create logos that are more simple yet get the point
                    across. and use the same icons throughout the app. I also want to put
                    the different sections in a hierarchy of importance while also
                    limiting the space they take up.
                </p>
                <h3>Research:</h3>
                <img src="images/wd/Workday5.jpg" />
                <h3>Before:</h3>

                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday4.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I researched other designs for each icon that I planned to recreate.
                    Here are some of the results I found as well as some ideas I created
                    for the new icons.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday5 copy.jpg" />
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday6.jpg" />
                <p>
                    In the final result, I redesigned the front page to make it look clean
                    and organized. I redesgined some of the icons and created a hierarchy
                    based on the importance and usage and added a section to see the
                    calendar.
                </p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday7.jpg" />
                <p>
                    The calendar design was edited to make it more visually appealing and
                    allow for information to be seen without have to select each day
                    individually.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday8.jpg" />
                <p>
                    To be able to redesign the calendar to be the most effective, I
                    researched a bit about different calendar layouts and also asked
                    people who use the Workday app about their experience using the
                    calendar feature. This helped me to create a more effective calendar
                    layout and fit the needs of those using the app.
                </p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday9.jpg" />
                <p>
                    For the calendar redesign, I decided to add events/work hours that can
                    be easily read without selecting each individual day. It is now easier
                    to see the schedule for the whole week or month.
                </p>
                <h3>Before and After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday10.jpg" />
                <p>
                    On the right is the before image, on the left is the redesign. For
                    this page, I again talked with people who were currently using the
                    app. There were quite a few issues that came up and my plan for the
                    page was to make it more useful. It should atomatically select the
                    current day and allow the user to select to input their time worked on
                    this page, as well as reposition the submit button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued to use the same design from the calendar page and
                    rearanged a few things such as the submit button and added a "Add
                    Hours/Start Time" to the page as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday11.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I plan on making it easier to enter time, both for clocking in and
                    clocking out. The main problem that I found when discussing this
                    feature with other people was that it was difficult to enter time and
                    change the entered time and that it was confusing. My plan is to make
                    it more user friendly.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday12.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Again I reseached other designs for clocks, ways to display time and
                    for inputting time. Above are some ideas I found.
                </p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday13.jpg" />
                <p>
                    On this page, I continued to use the same calendar set up, and
                    recreated the time inputsection. I made this page neater and more
                    userfriendly becuase it is easier to navitage.
                </p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday14.jpg" />
                <p>
                    My goal for the "My Account" page of the app was to reorganize the
                    sections by moving the "Organization ID" to the top so it is easy to
                    locate, and make the whole layout clean and neat.
                </p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday14.2.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Here is the end result, it has a similar feel to the rest of the app
                    with the colors and layout. It is meant to feel more organized with
                    the sections ordered by heirarchy of importance.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday15.jpg" />
                <p>Above are the main font styles and colors I used in the redesign.</p>
