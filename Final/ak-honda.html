                <p>
                    For this project, we were to research an area of interest that needed
                    an app or website to help with an issue that is present. This issue
                    was communication in a car dealership between the Sales team and the
                    Detail team. The solution was an app that would work for communication
                    and organization.

                <h3>The Problem and Idea:</h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up around car dealerships a lot because that is where my dad
                    worked. I would often hear about things that could be better around
                    the shop, more recently, I heard of the complications of communication
                    between the Sales team and the Detail team. With the help of my dad
                    and brother, we came up with this app idea to fix the problem that
                    they saw. The app will be designed for Car dealerships, to allow
                    better communication between the Sales team and the Detail team. This
                    will allow the two to communicate their ideas, problems, and be able
                    to plan out and keep in touch to keep the day going smoothly.
                </p>
                <h3>Research:</h3>
                <p>
                    From the research I conducted, there was not an app that covers the
                    areas that I want to in this app that I want to develop. There are
                    already messaging app such as Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, and Google
                    numbers. However, I plan to create this app so it can be personalized
                    to each dealership.
                </p>
                <h3>Audience:</h3>
                <p>
                    The main audience would be the employees of the car dealership. This
                    app would allow the Salesmen and the Detail Team, or the shop workers
                    to be able to work faster and more effectively so that they can better
                    meet the needs of their customers.
                </p>

                <h3>Visual Research:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are some other apps or designs that inspired me for the app. They
                    will also help to fulfill what I want to achieve with this app.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hd/hd2.png" />
                <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the scenarios I have written to test the key features of this
                    app. Through usability testing, I will be able to refine these
                    scenarios and the design of the app
                </p>
                <img src="images/hd/hd3.png" />
                <h3>Initial Design: Paper Prototype Part 1:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the paper prototypes I will be using. In the image is
                    scenario 2. I made this initial design on paper to be able to get all
                    my thoughts down and to make an initial design. I will make slight
                    changes for round 2 before beginning the digital prototype design.
                </p>

                <h3>Scenario Feedback Round 1: Paper Prototype Part 1:</h3>
                <img src="images/hd/hd5.png" />
                <h3>Initial design: Paper Prototype Part 2:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here I provided an improved version of the paper prototype. After my
                    first round of Usability Testing, I was able to learn where my design
                    was confusing and how I could make it better. Next will be to do
                    another round of Usability Testings with this version of the paper
                    prototypes and then start a digital prototype.
                </p>

                <h3>Scenario Feedback Round 2: Paper Prototype Part 2:</h3>
                <img src="images/hd/hd7.png" />
                <h3>Scenario Round 3: Updates Scenarios:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the improved scenarios I have written to test the key
                    features of this app. Through usability testing, I will be able to
                    refine these scenarios and the design of the app.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hd/hd8.png" />
                <h3>Scenario Round 3: Digital Prototype:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here I provided the first version of the digital prototype. After my
                    first and second rounds of Usability Testing, I was able to learn
                    where my design was confusing and how I could make it better. Now I
                    will be testing the digital prototype to see what else I can change
                    and fix. This prototype is an example created on XD and does not
                    function like a real app - it just looks like it does.
                </p>

                <h3>Scenario Feedback Round 3: Digital Prototype:</h3>
                <img src="images/hd/hd10.png" />
                <h3>Final Result:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here is the second version of the digital prototype. Again, after each
                    round of Usability Testing, I was able to learn where my design was
                    complicated or badly designed and was able to make it more user
                    friendly. After doing a final round of usability testing, I came up
                    with this design. This prototype is an example created on XD and does
                    not function like a real app - it just looks like it does.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hd/hd11.png" />
                <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
                <p>
                    During the process of developing this app, I was able to better
                    understand how to design an app to function in and for a work type
                    environment. I had to do an ample amount of research, both looking at
                    other already created apps that function similarly to how I wanted my
                    app to function, and also talk people in the industry that I was
                    working to design an app for. This helped a great deal because there
                    were things that I looked passed. I learned more about design and how
                    to create things so they would work well and be user friendly.
                </p>
                <h3>What I Would Change:</h3>
                <p>
                    There were some parts of the design of the app that I wasn’t very
                    satisfied with. While they worked in the technical sense, they could
                    have been more visually appealing. Also, while conducting the
                    usability testing with the owner of a car dealership, also my father,
                    he was pleased with the overall layout of the app, but also explained
                    the other needed aspects of the app if it were to be a real app. These
                    weren’t things I could add in now, but they would be needed to help
                    the dealership become more organized.
                </p>

                <img id="hd" src="images/hd/hd19.png" />
                <p>
                    TheShop is an app inspired by the needs of the Car Dealership that my
                    dad owns. Growing up my siblings and I would always spend a little
                    time a week there and it became very familiar. Recently, my brother
                    worked with my dad and had a few ideas to better organize the shop.
                    This included better communication between the employees
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shop is designed to connect to the system that the dealership
                    already uses, and helps with organization and communication even on
                    your phone.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add cars directly to your Shop Inventory</li>
                    <li>Easily send information to other employees efficiently</li>
                    <li>Move swiftly between pages to find cars, new, used, or sold</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Molding Through Usability Testing:</h3>
                <p>
                    TheShop went through three phases of Usability Testing, allowing me to
                    see where I can improve the design to make it more easily managed.
                    These Usability Tests were designed to test key features of the app.
                    It was reassuring to watch these tests as I saw where improvement was
                    necessary and where the design was working.
                </p>
                <p>These senarios were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding a car to the dealership inventory</li>
                    <li>Finding a specific car in the dealership inventory/car lot</li>
                    <li>Sending the specific car in the app messaging system</li>
                    <li>Finding the messaging feature of the app</li>
                    <li>Sending a message</li>
                    <li>Marking a car as sold</li>
                </ul>
                <img id="hd" src="images/hd/hd12.png" />
                <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                <p>Here we will look at how you might use TheShop.</p>
                <p>
                    Say you are a Salesman and want to send a message to the Detail team
                    about a car a customer is looking to buy.
                </p>
