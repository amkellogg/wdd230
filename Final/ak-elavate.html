                <h1>Case Study: Elevate</h1>
                <p>An app designed to help record your outdoor progress</p>
                <img src="images/elavate.jpg" />
                <p>
                    For this project, we were to create the layout of an app that we
                    wanted to exist. I created the outline of an app that would track a
                    persons hiking performance. The purpose would be to improve health,
                    and help people make and achieve their goals.
                </p>
                <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
                <p>School: Brigham Young University - Idaho</p>
                <p>Date Completed: February 2021</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>
                    Normal exercise apps don't track the elavation changes when hiking.
                    This app is designed to help people track their hiking/outdoor
                    preformance, improve health, or set and achieve their goals. This app
                    was inspired by those who decided to make a change in their life
                    during COVID 19 and live a healthier lifestyle, also hoping to
                    encourage others to do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to track their distance, even when elevation
                    changes - such as hiking hills or mountains - or track their calorie
                    burn after each recorded hike. They can compare distance, calorie
                    burn, steps taken, ect. to other hikes on previous days, months, or
                    years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before getting started, I needed to know what apps where already out
                    there so I could understand what was needed for this app to work and
                    have all the functions that other apps are lacking. I researched
                    similar apps that calculate distance, elevation, time, speed,
                    calories, and other things that I intend on using as features in this
                    app.
                </p>
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <img src="images/elavate/Elevate4.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Here is a quick overview of the process. I first began with sketching
                    my idea out on paper. Then began Usability Testing.
                </p>
                <h3>Usability Testing Round 1:</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three scenarios to test key features of my app. To test
                    them, I designed a rough prototype where I then gathered feedback from
                    participants. Here is what I learned.
                </p>
                <h3>Scenarios and Tasks:</h3>
                <p>
                    1. During the COVID 19 pandemic, you decided to find a way to stay
                    healthy physically while also keeping a safe distance from others. You
                    were drawn to hiking and wanted to track your daily distance and
                    calorie burn. You just downloaded the app "Elevate". Task: Launch the
                    app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. You just finished a hike and you want to check how far you hiked.
                    Task: Check your total hiking stats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. After checking your overall hiking outcome, you want to check the
                    calorie burn of your hike. Task: Check your calorie burn.
                </p>
                <h3>Paper Prototype: Round 1:</h3>

                <img src="images/elavate/round1.jpg" />

                <h3>Results From Round 1 Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    What I learned from the first round of usibilty tests was: how to
                    better phrase the scenarios, how to better word the names on buttons
                    and how to effectively arrange them - in order of most importance and
                    most used, as well as using categories or how to fit the categories
                    into less buttons/ sections. This will help the users better
                    understand the puposes of the buttons.
                </p>

                <h3>Usability Testing Round 2:</h3>

                <h3>Scenarios and Tasks:</h3>
                <p>
                    1. During the COVID 19 pandemic, you decided to find a way to stay
                    healthy physically while also keeping a safe distance from others. You
                    were drawn to hiking and wanted to track your daily distance and
                    calorie burn. You just downloaded the app "Elevate". Task: Launch the
                    app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. You just finished a hike and you want to see how well the app
                    recorded the data. Task: Check how many calories you burned while
                    hiking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. You just checked your overall calorie burn of your hike, now you
                    want to check the distance and elevation change during the hike. Task:
                    Check your distance and elevation change from the hike.
                </p>
                <h3>Paper Prototype: Round 2:</h3>

                <h3>Results From Round 2 Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    What I learned from the second round of usibilty testing: how to make
                    users feel more comfortable when inputting their personal information.
                    I also learned how to better organize or plan out the buttons on the
                    app so that it is easier to navigate through the app.

                <h3>Digital Prototype: Round 3:</h3>
                <img src="images/elavate/round3.jpg" />
                <h3>Results From Round 3 Testing: What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    As I tested the first digitally designed prototype, I noticed that I
                    needed to fix the scrolling option, as well as increase the size of
                    some buttons. It was difficult for people to click on some buttons and
                    they would repeatedly try until it worked. I also learned how to
                    simulate scrolling, which at first I had difficulty adding. Scrolling
                    should be simple and easy, or it gets frustrating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned the importance of the heirarchy of scale when dealing with
                    text, buttons, information, and anything where there are users from
                    many different aspects of life. It was importanct to test different
                    age groups and people from different backgrounds to make sure you
                    aren't overlooking small things when designing a product.
