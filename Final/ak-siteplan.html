                    <h2>The Color Scheme</h2>
                    <h3 class="color-1">Primary Color</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be used as the primary color on the website. It is a
                        darker blue which can help people feel calm and trust the site. It
                        will be used in some of the main headings and can also be found in
                        the footer..
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="color-2">Secondary Color</h3>
                    <p>
                        This secondary color will be used as a filler color or a
                        background color on some pages of the website. It is a simple off
                        white and can be easy to read when under text and can also be
                        found in the footer..
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="color-3">Accent Color #1</h3>
                    <p>
                        This accent color will be used in the header and the footer of the
                        page and can be found in the logo of the page.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="color-4">Accent Color #2</h3>
                    <p>
                        This accent color will show up when any links are hovered over and
                        can also be found in the footer.

                    <h2>The Typography</h2>
                    <h3 id="font-1">Montserrat</h3>
                    <p id="font-1">
                        This font will be used for the headings of the websire. It is a
                        san serif which is simple and easy to read and see while also
                        being professional.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="font-2">Fira Sans</h3>
                    <p id="font-2">
                        The font Fira Sans pairs well with Montserrat and is a good
                        contrast. While Montserrat is thicker and heavier, Fira Sans is a
                        thin smaller type face that will work well as captions and smaller
                        areas of text.
