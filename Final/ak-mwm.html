                <img src="images/MWM4.png" />
                <p>
                    Mills Wealth Management is a family owned business for families and
                    other individuals that are looking for help with finances and
                    financial advice. I had the opportunity to take on this website and
                    design a new version to help customers find what they are looking for
                    and to be able to get the help they need.
                </p>
                <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
                <p>Company: Mills Wealth Management</p>
                <p>Date Completed: March 2022</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>
                    A family business started in then 1960’s, the Mills had created a
                    simple website and haven’t had time to redesign it. I had the
                    opportunity to help them and their family business to create a new
                    look for their website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having their purpose in mind, I knew that their website was a big part
                    of how people view them. Their clients need to know they can trust
                    this family business with their finances.
                </p>
                <img src="images/MWM2.png" />
                <p>
                    I began on Miro, working with their colors to try to recreate their
                    website into something that others will see and trust. There is plenty
                    of information to work with, but it is important to be able to
                    organize it in a way that is easy to navigate and understand, while
                    also removing unneeded information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with this family to make sure the design was exactly how they
                    wanted it, recreating their logo during this time as well so they have
                    it on hand.
                </p>
                <img src="images/MWM3.png" />
                <p>
                    Through this process, I learned about other Financial Practices to be
                    able to understand the industry and be able to match the feeling of
                    those websites. I noticed they mostly use blue, a calming color, and
                    have been designed to look very professional.
