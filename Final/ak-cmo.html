                <p>
                    The Clean Mobility Options team at CALSTART was just beginning to
                    start the redesign process when I started as an intern with them. I
                    jumped on the website and began fixing small things in the old website
                    and then began to design the new website. I would take the old website
                    pages and recreate them to be engaging, interesting and beautiful,
                    while also displaying the information that was needed.

                <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
                <p>Company: CALSTART</p>
                <p>Date Completed: November 2021</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>
                    I was brought onto the team to aid in the redesigning of their
                    website. As a new member to the team, I was ready to get started and
                    work to use my skills to help in this process. We began first with any
                    small necessary changes on the existing website and then set off to
                    see what was wrong and how we create it a new.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before anything else, a page outline was needed. We needed to know how
                    many pages there were in the site. Wow many of those were the main
                    pages and needed to be found in the menu? Which pages in the menu had
                    a drop down leading to similar pages?
                </p>
                <img src="images/CMO2.png" />
                <p>
                    We decided to create a Miro group where I began to create multiple
                    designs according to what we had decided on for the redesign. Using
                    the Brand Guide that was provided, we decided on colors and fonts that
                    would work best, always checking back to make sure it would all be ADA
                    compliant and match the new feel they were going for with a redesign.
                </p>

                <img src="images/CMO3.png" />
                <p>
                    There were many changes as we went through this process, refining the
                    colors so that the website looked and felt professional, and creating
                    a whole new feel to the website.
                </p>
                <img src="images/CMO4.png" />
                <p>
                    As we went on through each design for each page, we created a header
                    and footer, and made sure each page continued with the same design
                    aspects. When needed, I would create icons/logos for the pages.
                </p>
                <img src="images/CMO5.png" />
                <p>
                    The end result was clean and new. Aiding to the original purpose of
                    the website and team.
