                <h3>White Space</h3>
                <h4>Cricut</h4>
                <a class="link" href="https://cricut.com/en_us">cricut.com</a>
                <img alt="cricut page" src="images-2/cricutpage.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I chose this website for an example of white space because
                    nothing feels crowded, they use their space effectively and
                    there isnâ€™t too much going on on one part of the webpage.

                <h3>Contrast</h3>
                <h4>National Geographic</h4>
                <a class="link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/"
                    >nationalgeographic.com</a
                >
                <img alt="nationalgeographic page" src="images-2/NGpage.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I chose this website for contrast because they worked very
                    well with a black background, everything is still very
                    legible and simple. They chose colors that work well
                    together even with a dark background.

                <h3>Repetition</h3>
                <h4>Pizza Hut</h4>
                <a class="link" href="https://www.pizzahut.com/"
                    >pizzahut.com</a
                >
                <img alt="pizza hut page" src="images-2/pizzapage.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I was surprised at the neatness of their website. While
                    selling something so simple, they were able to keep their
                    products organized by using repetition in their design with
                    the different boxes for each option.
